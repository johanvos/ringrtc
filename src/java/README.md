The Java implementation consists of 2 Java projects, and a Rust component.

tringapi: this contains the API that can be accessed by the application,
without any dependencies (no application model classes or ringrtc structs).
It uses the Java ServiceLoader concept to find implementations of the
TringService.

tring: this contains platform-specific implementations of the TringService.
The source code is mainly auto-generated by jextract. The implementation
itself is in TringServiceImpl, and it is made available via module-info.java

Rust component:
java.rs contains the implementation of methods invoked by TringServiceImpl.
It is similar to electron.js

BUILDING:
Check out the webrtc sources and build them. This can be done using the electron target:

make electron platform=UNIX

This will checkout and compile webrtc, and it will build rust code. Next, build the Java
artifacts:

make java
